# F1L-ComBio-2024

# Intro 
This repository will contain my progress throughout the Pharma/biotech internship imulatro with Dean Lee. The weekly updates will contain my thoughts, questions and codes as I dive deeper into learning about scRNA-seq analysis in the contxt of cancer therapy and drug discovery. 

# Week 1
Development of an effective and safe drug treatment for cancer therapy requires multiple steps of validation using computational modeling systems, cell lines, animal models and patient-drived xenografts proior to the human subject clinical trials. Here I want to use the online scRNA-seq data to explor the theraputic benefits of following FDA-approved drugs for other cancer types.
